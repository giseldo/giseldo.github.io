<h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The self-regulated learning is defined as the extent to which
students are metacognitively, motivationally and behaviorally engaged in
their own learning process. The metacognitive processes refer to the
ability of students to establish learning plans, schedules or goals to
monitor or evaluate their learning progress, while the motivational
processes indicate that students are self-motivated and willing to take
responsibility for their successes or failures. Self-regulated learning
is a significant factor in academic performance in traditional learning
[9].</p>
<p>Various students can benefit from the use of learned self-regulation
strategies in the classroom, particularly in favorable teaching
environments, especially students with low academic performance in
school. It is understood that investigating which learning
self-regulation strategies are more effective can be recommended, which
can help college students improve their academic performance.</p>
<p>It is evident that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
can aid in the process of self-regulation. According to [19], the
utilization of ICT resources is crucial in contributing to the
construction of learning, as the student takes on the role of managing
the construction of their own knowledge. With ICT, it will be possible
to coordinate the pace and manner of establishing recognition,
selection, and processing of information. ICT can serve as tools that
assist in the self-regulation of the student, aiming to help him in his
organization and, particularly, to bring contributions to the
development of new learning abilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is essential to investigate which strategies are most
effective and which can be recommended, with the aim of helping students
improve their academic performance [1] [21]. The objective of this study
is to use ICT to analyze the self-regulation profile of students, with
the aim of recommending strategic actions for self-regulation of
learning as well as presenting corrective action recommendations. To
achieve the proposed objective, qualitative research was conducted,
enabling the collection of descriptive data about the students’ behavior
in relation to their learning method. Our case study used a sample
composed of 43 students from two masters’ degree courses.</p>
<p>Considering that academic performance is directly related to
self-regulated learning, an expected contribution of this study is that
the academic performance of students will improve if they self-regulate,
and students can also increase their academic achievement if they
understand the methodology used.</p>
<h1 id="sec:self-regulated-learning">Self-regulated Learning</h1>
<p>The self-regulated learning is the application of self-regulation
theory in the learning environment. A self-regulated student is a
student who approaches educational tasks with confidence, diligence, and
ease. Therefore, self-regulated students may have the ability to
evaluate their learning strategies and choose their skills and areas of
weakness, as they can modify learning strategies to achieve the desired
academic result [12].</p>
<p>The self-regulated learning process is divided into different phases:
planning, execution, and evaluation. In the planning phase, students
analyze the task, choose strategies that best address a specific
learning challenge, and define their learning goals. During the
execution phase, students carry out the task, adjust their plan while
monitoring progress, and activate strategies to meet their needs. In the
evaluation phase, strategies and results are evaluated in relation to
the strategies used and results achieved [15]</p>
<p>There are several proposals for self-regulation in learning. [2]
developed a model that uses emotion regulation, behavior, and cognition,
and established stages to effectively use learning strategies and
enhance academic performance. They concluded that effective emotional
management is a critical factor in the matter of self-regulation.</p>
<p>Another proposal is the study of Soares et al. (2018), which extended
beyond the emotional aspect and indicated that students’ academic
performance depends on various factors, including personal, social,
familial, educational, and environmental factors, as well as
self-regulation processes, which contribute to motivation and academic
learning. These self-regulation strategies are directly linked to
performance. Through the introduction of learning strategies,
particularly with the inclusion of supportive and motivational work,
there is an expressive improvement in academic performance by students,
filling in deficiencies in information processing in various areas and
contributing to the regulation of cognitive, emotional, and motivational
aspects related to learning [4].</p>
<p>There are various methods for measuring self-regulated learning, as
suggested by [16, 17], who developed the metric scale MSLQ - Motivated
Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. It comprises 81 items that are
used to assess students’ motivational orientation and learning strategy
use in a particular course or subject. In the motivation category,
components of expectations (beliefs in control and self-efficacy), value
(intrinsic, extrinsic, and task value), and affective (exam anxiety) are
evaluated.</p>
<h1
id="sec:self-regulated-learning-strategies:-the-use-of-ict">Self-regulated
learning strategies: The use of ICT</h1>
<p>Learning strategies are integrated sequences of procedures or
activities, chosen with the purpose of facilitating the acquisition,
storage, and utilization of information [3]. These strategies, in terms
of usage, can be cognitive and metacognitive (repetition, elaboration,
organization, critical thinking, and metacognition) and strategies for
resource management (study time and place, effort regulation, modeling,
and help-seeking) [17].</p>
<p>The inclusion of ICT in teaching strategies should emphasize the
inclusion of practices mediated by technologies based on the concept of
space/time for learning, since, with the use of ICT, new virtual spaces
are established, with the possibility of exploring dynamic environments
and developing networks of relationships. The flexibility of space/time
enhances new ways of learning. Technological resources alone do not
establish a contextualized curriculum, but they can enhance it [7].</p>
<p>For [14], the use of digital technologies modifies the
teaching-learning process and the environment in which they are inserted
creating a relationship composed of the teacher, the student and the
content, in which the interactions are formed. According to the authors
3 the fases where this occurs are: 1) teacher-technology: in which the
teacher will choose a technological artifact that can promote the
students’ knowledge; 2) student-technology: which allows the constant
interaction of the student with the digital technological tool, in which
the reflection-action-reflection process occurs; and 3)
teacher-student-technology: it is the mixture of the previous
relationships, in which the teacher acts as a mediator in the search for
the construction of knowledge.</p>
<p>Technological educational resources are potentially a positive factor
for the development of self-regulated learning processes, allowing
students to concentrate more on the proposed activities. These resources
should be developed openly, based on a dynamic of hypermedia
applications, to produce effects that develop complex thinking, an
essential support for self-regulated learning, enabling students to
produce knowledge that they recognize as being of formative importance.
The diversity of cognitive profiles reinforces the need for
technological educational resources to have an open exploration dynamic
and a structure that allows students to be cognitively flexible
[10].</p>
<p>In education, the use of ICT has also been growing, and using it as
an ally in teaching activities can ensure greater student learning.
Traditional classes tend to no longer hold students’ attention, so the
use of alternative methodologies, techniques, environments, and
technologies becomes a differentiator [6]. According to [13], the main
challenges for teachers are choosing appropriate methods and tools that
maintain student motivation and engagement, as well as scalability and
personalization of teaching.</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that technology can help students in the
learning process, as it is a driving tool, that is, the available
resources can be more attractive and have effective possibilities for
the user to organize themselves [5]. However, it is necessary to be
cautious, attentive, and critically observant to assess whether a given
technological instrument, in addition to facilitating the performance of
an action, will also satisfy, respond to, and solve current demands.
[20] highlights the need to train autonomous individuals, who master
knowledge and are able to manipulate technological instruments, which
require constant actions to solve problems in the context of globalized
society.</p>
<p>To respond to the proposed objective, a qualitative study was
conducted that made it possible to obtain descriptive data on the
behavior of students in relation to their learning style. Qualitative
research is important in the educational field, as it is essential for
understanding human reality, the difficulties experienced, the attitudes
and behaviors of the subjects involved, and therefore constitutes an
essential theoretical support for educational research [8].</p>
<p>The literature review, prior to the application of the questionnaire,
was carried out through a bibliographic survey of articles in the areas
of education, psychology and computer science in education. Studies that
used the questionnaire based on the MSLQ metric scale were then
consulted to identify approaches to the theme of self-regulation.</p>
<p>These latter studies made it possible to construct a questionnaire
using the online survey administration application Google Forms, which
was answered by the students who participated in this study. Since the
MSLQ questionnaire was originally written in English, it was translated
and adapted from English to Portuguese.</p>
<p>The sample consisted of 43 students from 2 (two) higher education
Brazilian courses. It is important to note that the invitation was sent
to 150 students via email and WhatsApp, but only 43 responded. One of
the researchers had already had prior contact with these students. A
step-by-step process that was carried out during the research is
described in Figure <a href="#fig:method" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:method">1</a>.</p>
<figure id="fig:method">
<img src="method.png" style="width:90.0%" />
<figcaption>Step-by-step process</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The original questionnaire has 81 questions, divided into 15 areas
(or constructs). The questionnaire used in this study has 44 questions
related to motivation and learning strategies, based on concrete
situations related to the participants’ teaching and learning. The
student was asked to classify the answers to the 44 items based on their
behavior in each subject. To do so, they had to choose one of the
subjects they found most difficult, and their classification had to be
on a scale of 7 (seven) points, where 1 (one) means “completely false”
and 7 (seven) means “completely true”.</p>
<p>The 44 questions are grouped in 13 (thirteen) constructs, divided
into two scales: motivation and learning strategies. The motivation
scale assessed the following constructs: intrinsic goal orientation,
extrinsic goal orientation, activity appreciation, learning control,
learning self-efficacy, and test anxiety [16, 18]. The learning
strategies scale assessed cognitive and metacognitive strategies through
the analysis of the construct’s rehearsal/memorization, elaboration,
organization, critical thinking, and metacognitive self-regulation; as
well as study management through the analysis of the constructs study
time and environment and effort management [16, 18].</p>
<p>The data extracted from the questionnaires were analyzed and the
profiles of self-regulated students were outlined, as well as the
strategies they use to self-regulate, establishing a relationship with
academic performance. The 13 constructs assessed in the questionnaire
have a set of questions measured through the arithmetic mean obtained by
the number of questions related to each construct [16].</p>

<figcaption>Systems Dynamics Diagram of the Motivation Scale in
Learning</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Regarding goal orientation, according to [16], it is understood that
it refers to the student’s perception of the reasons why he/she is
involved in a learning task. Thus, in the questionnaire, goal
orientation is linked to the student’s orientation towards the course,
as can be seen in Table 1 and Table 2.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:ds2" data-reference-type="ref"

<p>After a student completes the questionnaire, we email the student the
results in a PDF attachment. An example of a PDF attachment to a
fictitious student’s email is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:email"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:email">3</a>.</p>
<p>Table 1: MSLQ - Constructs and Questions assessed in the MSLQ for the
Motivation Scales CONSTRUCTS QUESTIONS Intrinsic Goal Orientation I
prefer challenging classwork where I can learn new things. I tend to
choose subject topics that I will learn something from, even if they
require more work. Extrinsic Goal Orientation Compared to other students
in this class, I expect to do well. I think I will get a good grade in
this class. Valuing Activity It is important to me to learn what is
being taught in class. I like what I am learning in class. I think I
will be able to use what I learned in this class in other classes. I
think what I am learning in this class is useful for my learning. I
think what we are learning in this class is interesting. Understanding
this topic is important to me. Learning Control Compared to other
students, I think I am a good student. My study skills are excellent
compared to others in this class. Compared to other students in this
class, I think I know a lot about the content. Learning Self-Efficacy I
am confident that I can understand the ideas taught in this course. I
expect to do very well in this class. I am confident that I can do an
excellent job on the problems and assignments assigned in this class. I
know I can learn the material for this class. Test Anxiety I get so
nervous during a test that I can’t remember the material I’ve learned. I
feel uncomfortable and upset when I take a test. I worry a lot about
tests. When I take a test, I think about how bad I am doing. When I
study for a test, I try to remember as many facts as I can.</p>
<h1 id="sec:results">Results</h1>
<p>The results analyzed in the motivation and learning strategies scale
are presented in Figure <a href="#fig:mot" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:mot">4</a> and Figure <a href="#fig:ler"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ler">5</a>. Of the 43
students, the majority (93%) have an orientation to intrinsic goals,
which concerns the degree to which the student perceives that he or she
is participating in a task for reasons such as challenge, curiosity, and
mastery (e.g., “I prefer challenging classwork in which I can learn new
things”, “I tend to choose subject topics from which I will learn
something, even if they require more work”).</p>
<p>84% of students have an extrinsic goal orientation. Extrinsic
orientation complements intrinsic orientation and refers to the degree
to which the student perceives that he or she is participating in a task
for reasons such as grades, rewards, performance, evaluation, and
competition. When someone is rich in extrinsic goal orientation,
engaging in a learning task is the means to achieve a certain purpose
[16].</p>
<p>Regarding the “value of the activity”, this differs from goal
orientation, as it refers to the student’s evaluation of how
interesting, important, and useful the activity is, while goal
orientation is associated with the reasons why the student is
participating in the activity [16]. The vast majority of the students
(98%) analyzed “value the activities” (for example, “I think I will be
able to use what I learned in this class in other classes”, “It is
important for me to learn what is being taught in class”, which is very
important. [16] states that valuing the activity should lead the student
to become more involved in learning.</p>

<p>Table 2: MSLQ - Constructs and Questions assessed in the MSLQ for
Learning Strategies. CONSTRUCTS QUESTIONS Memorization When I do
homework, I try to remember what the teacher said in class so that I can
answer the questions correctly. I work on practice exercises and answer
the questions at the end of the chapter, even when I don’t have to. When
I study for a test, I practice by repeating important facts over and
over to myself. I use what I learned from old homework assignments and
the textbook to do new assignments. When I read the materials for this
class, I say the words over and over to myself to help me remember.
Working When I study for a test, I try to gather the information from
class in a notebook. When I read, I try to connect the things I’m
reading about with what I already know. Organization It’s hard for me to
decide what the main ideas are in what I read. When I study, I take
notes to remind myself of the material I’ve studied. I outline the
chapters of my textbook to help me study. Critical Thinking When I
study, I put important ideas into my own words. Metacognitive
Self-Regulation I ask questions to make sure I know the material I’ve
studied. I often think I know what the lecture is about, but I don’t
know what it’s about. (Reverse) I find that when the teacher is talking,
I think about other things and don’t really listen to what they’re
saying. (Reverse) When I’m studying material, I try to make it all fit
together. When I’m reading, I sometimes stop and repeat what I’ve read.
Study Time and Environment Before I start studying, I think about the
things I’ll need to do to learn. Even when I do poorly on a test, I try
to learn from my mistakes. Effort Management When the work is hard, I
give up or study only the easy parts. (Reverse) I always try to
understand what the teacher is saying, even if it doesn’t make sense.
Even when the study materials are boring and uninteresting, I keep doing
the assignment until I finish it. I work hard to get a good grade, even
when I don’t like a class.</p>
<p>Learning control refers to students’ beliefs that their efforts to
learn will result in positive results. It concerns the belief that
results depend on their own efforts [16]. According to the data, 84% of
the students surveyed have control over their learning. If students
believe that their efforts to study make a difference in their learning,
they are likely to study strategically and effectively. In other words,
if the student believes that they can control their academic
performance, they are likely to do whatever is necessary strategically
to make the desired changes [16].</p>

<figcaption>Learning strategy</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The items that make up this scale assess two aspects of expectation,
expectation of success and self-efficacy (e.g., “I am confident that I
can understand the ideas taught in this course”, “I know that I will be
able to learn the material for this class”), the majority (97%) of the
students analyzed have learning self-efficacy. Expectation of success
refers to performance expectations and specifically to the performance
of the activity, while self-efficacy is a self-assessment of the ability
to master a task. Self-efficacy includes judgments about the ability to
perform a task, as well as confidence in the abilities to perform that
task [16].</p>
<p>A little over half (59%) of students have test anxiety. On this
subject, [16] found that test anxiety is negatively related to academic
expectations and performance. Test anxiety has two components: the worry
component, which refers to students’ negative thoughts that hinder
performance (e.g., “I worry a lot about tests”), and the emotional
component, which refers to aspects of affective and physiological
arousal of anxiety (e.g., “I feel uncomfortable and upset when I take a
test”). Cognitive worry and worry about performance are the greatest
sources of reduced performance. Therefore, training in the use of
effective learning strategies and test-taking skills should help reduce
the level of anxiety [16].</p>
<p>In the present study, 82% of the students who responded to the survey
used rehearsal strategies. According to [11], moods play an important
role in the acquisition, encoding, storage and retrieval of information
in memory, so the chances of accessing a material in memory will be
greater if the individual’s particular mood is of the same affective
valence when it is stored.</p>
<p>In the questionnaire, [16] states that basic rehearsal strategies
involve reciting or naming items from a list to be learned. These
strategies are used for simple tasks and activation of information in
working memory, rather than acquisition of new information in long-term
memory (e.g., “When I study for a test, I practice by repeating the
important facts over and over to myself”, “When I read the materials for
this class, I say the words over and over to myself to help me
remember”).</p>
<p>Elaboration strategies help students store information in long-term
memory by creating internal connections between the items to be learned.
The vast majority (97%) of students use elaboration strategies, such as
paraphrasing, summarizing, creating analogies, or taking notes (e.g.,
“When reading, I try to connect the things I am reading about with what
I already know”). Thus, this strategies helps the student integrate and
connect new information with prior knowledge [16].</p>
<p>Organization strategies allow students to select appropriate
information and build connections between the information to be learned
(e.g., “When studying, I take notes to remind myself of the subject I
studied”). It was found that 77% of students use the organization
learning strategy. This strategy is very important, since organizing is
an active effort resulting in student involvement in the activity,
tending to produce better academic performance [16].</p>
<p>It was also possible to verify that 93% of students have critical
thinking, which, according to [16], refers to the degree to which
students report applying their prior knowledge to new situations to
solve problems, make decisions or make critical assessments with respect
to standards of excellence.</p>
<p>Additionally, 84% of students have metacognitive self-regulation. The
focus of the questions was on the control and self-regulation aspects of
metacognition, not on the knowledge aspect (e.g., “I often think I know
what the class is about, but I don’t know what it’s about”, “I find that
when the teacher is talking, I think about other things and don’t really
listen to what he or she is saying”). It is understood that regulatory
activities improve performance by helping students to check and correct
their behavior as they proceed with an activity.</p>
<p>In addition to self-regulation of cognition, students must be able to
manage and regulate their time and study environments. Time management
involves scheduling, planning, and managing study time, demonstrated by
77% of the students participating in the survey. Time management can
range from a night of studying to weekly and monthly scheduling. In
turn, management of the study environment refers to the setting where
the student studies, which should be organized, quiet, and relatively
free of visual and auditory distractions [16].</p>
<p>Self-regulation also includes students’ ability to control their
effort and attention in the face of distractions and uninteresting tasks
(e.g., “When work is difficult, I give up or study only the easy parts”,
“Even when study materials are monotonous and uninteresting, I continue
to do the task until I finish it”), according to [16], verifying that
89% of the students who carried out the survey use the effort management
strategy. Effort management is self-management and reflects the
commitment to meet study goals, even when there are difficulties or
distractions. Effort management is important for academic success,
because it not only means commitment to goals, but also regulates the
continued use of learning strategies [16].</p>
<h1 id="threats-to-validity">Threats to validity</h1>
<p>The sample size of participants in the study represents a threat to
the validity of the study. A small sample size may not be representative
of the general user population, meaning results may not be generalizable
to a wider audience. A larger, more diverse group of participants would
have strengthened the validity of the study and provided more meaningful
conclusions.</p>
<p>The research team recognizes the need for future research and
classroom experiments with a larger number of users and different
settings to further validate these preliminary findings.</p>
<h1 id="related-works">Related Works</h1>
<p>Some other papers offer valuable insights as related works into the
relationship between educational systems recommendations and academic
performance. [22] link between Moodle interactions and academic
performance using educational data mining in a Philippine university,
revealing the significant potential for personalized learning through
these interactions. [23] delves into how students’ motivation, desire to
work, and curiosity, especially in the post-COVID-19 era, influence
their learning outcomes. This study underscores the importance of
considering these factors when designing educational recommendation
systems that cater to individual student needs.</p>
<p>Our proposal stands out in comparison to other educational systems
analyzed for its innovative approach that integrates personalization
self-regulated learning personality traits. While other systems, such as
those utilizing Moodle interactions or focusing on student motivation,
provide valuable insights for improving academic performance, our work
goes further by proposing a model that not only tailors’ educational
recommendations to individual student needs but also considers
fundamental aspects of student psychology. This contrasts with systems
that traditionally focus on behavioral metrics, such as interactions on
learning platforms or isolated motivational factors, without deeply
integrating personality traits.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>Self-regulated learning as a learning strategy in higher education
has proven to be an important factor in influencing students’ knowledge
gain, as well as in motivating their learning and improving their
academic performance. This study aims to help provide a better
understanding of how this resource has been used over the years in
education, seeking to highlight its main uses and meanings.</p>
<p>During the experiment, feedback was sent to each student who answered
the questionnaire, with the scores for the constructs evaluate, the
averages obtained by all students participating in the study, along with
a description of their assessment, recommending how they should increase
their motivation levels and how to work on their learning
strategies.</p>
<p>The results of this study serve as parameters for teachers and
students to better understand the motivation profiles and self-regulated
learning strategies. Most students who participated in the study, even
without specific knowledge on the subject, already applied
self-regulated learning strategies in their academic life. The least
used learning strategies in our sample were “Organization” and “Study
time”. Test anxiety was relatively high, with more than half reporting
anxiety problems.</p>
<p>As a contribution to be reversed for the participants, feedback was
provided to each student who answered the questionnaire, including the
scores for each of the constructs assess, and the averages obtained by
all students, along with a description of their assessment, recommending
how they should increase their motivation levels and how to work on
their learning strategies. The results of this study will contribute to
improving academic performance and motivating students to learn more
using self-regulated learning strategies.</p>
